/**
 * @file events.cpp
 * @brief Defines classes for handling events
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the EventLoop, KqueueEventLoop, and
 * EpollEventLoop classes. The EventLoop class is an abstract base class that
 * provides an interface for creating event loops. The KqueueEventLoop class
 * inherits from the EventLoop class and implements an event loop that uses the
 * kqueue system call. The EpollEventLoop class inherits from the EventLoop
 * class and implements an event loop that uses the epoll system call.
 *
 * @note The KqueueEventLoop class is only available on MacOS and the
 * EpollEventLoop class is only available on Linux.
 *
 * @note This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used in
 * production environments without extensive testing and modification.
